Dear Diary,

Hello, my name is Katherine Michelle Yut, but I go by Katy. It's Wednesday, March 31, 2021. This project is due in less than a week and I definitely should've started it earlier. I was gonna start it yesterday, but my partner Frankie surprised me with a short visit. This is a document that contains sensitive information. I sure hope my personal information is secure. It sure would fucking suck if he (Big Brother) found out all my secrets. I'd be really mad and would probably complain to President Harroz by calling (405) 325-3916. Even better, I'll call senator Cornyn at 202-224-2934 and give him a piece of my goddamn mind.
