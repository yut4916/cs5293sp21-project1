## How to Install and Use This Package
To run: first, activate virtual environment by running "source .env/bin/activate". Then, run the following:
pipenv run python redactor.py --input '\*.txt' \
                    --names --dates --phones \
                    --concept 'kids' \
                    --output 'files/' \
                    --stats stderr

## Assumptions/Definitions
Name:
* A name is

Gender:
* Includes pronouns: he, him, his, she, her, hers, they, them, theirs
* Family descriptors: brother, sister, mother/mom/mommy, father/dad/daddy, aunt, uncle, grandpa, grandma, son, daughter
* Titles: Mr., Ms., Mrs., Miss 

1. Input file(s) will be in .txt format
2. The text will be in English

## Function Descriptions


## Approach/Steps/Inner Monologue/Project Diary
1. Setup file structure (i.e., duplicate and rename project0 directory)
	+ clean out proj0 README
	+ paste bare bones code provided in project outline
2. Revisit project goal: read in any/all .txt files provided and redact sensitive information (i.e., identify and replace with full block character)
	+ Intermediate requirements include: defining names, dates, phone numbers, concepts, etc. Rewatch lecture to see how Randy added flags. Figure out where to start and how to break it down into smaller, more manageable chunks. 
	+ Yeah ok I'm not really sure where to start, but I know I'm going to need some test data, so let's do that. I wrote a short test document and I'm starting to get my bearings.
3. Write skeleton code with the functions I'll need to complete the project.
	+ I think I'll need a function for each input flag -- i.e., redactNames(), redactGenders(), redactDates(), redactPhones(), and redactConcepts().
	+ I've included some print statements at the beginning and end of each function, so I can see when they're running. 
	+ I'll need to use the user-supplied glob to open the text file(s), which I can do with the open() function.
		- note: will apparently need to close the file when I'm done with it! (use fileVariable.close())
	+ So far, when I run it, it seems to be working just fine. I guess now I need to figure out how I'm going to do this redacting business?
4. Conceptualizing a general solution
	+ okay, so I know I'm going to need to use spacy/nltk. I guess I'll want to tokenize the text files, do some standardization techniques from class/the textbook, and then compare the cleaned text to some sort of dictionary for each of my tags.
		- need to figure out if those dictionaries exist within spacy/nltk or if I'm supposed to create/define them myself
	+ reading some basic [spacy 101](https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101), i think that's the one I'm gonna wanna go with (at least to start).
5. Lots of different directions to go in. Some I have been exploring:
	+ best so far: Named Entity Recognition (NER) using .ents on spacy doc objects
	+ Token from spacy.tokens
	+ Matcher from spacy.matcher
	+ regex - issues w/ spacy token type and string compatibility
6. I figured out how to set up the stats file, so there's that. 
	+ it still definitely needs to be cleaned/processed though - maybe that should be done before i write it to a .txt....
7. Found a good regex for matching phone numbers on a stack overflow thread 
	+ How I found it: r'^(\+\d{1,2}\s)?\(?\d{3}\)?[\s.-]?\d{3}[\s.-]?\d{4}$'
	+ After my minor tweaks: r'(\+\d{1,2}\s)?(\(?\d{3}\)?[\s.-]?)?\d{3}[\s.-]?\d{4}'
8. Besides plain ol' regex for the phone numbers, I've been making decent headway with the named entity recognition technique. It works better by including an if statement to redact by each type of entity (person, date, organization, location, etc) instead of anything that registers as an entity
	+ note: for the custom named entity from a word list of gendered terms, I'll probably need to do some text normalization beforehand, since my dictionary doesn't account for pluralities, etc
	+ also, the named entities have a lot more categories than just the required names and dates. I could easily copy those functions and create additional flags for locations, organizations, etc
9. Still left to do:
	+ all of the concepts function
	+ all of writing tests
	+ flesh out/tidy up/complete README
	+ very last - record demo video
10. Successfully set up an API key with Merriam Webster, so hopefully I can figure out how to use that for the concepts flag. My plan is to grab a list of related words from their collegiate thesaurus.


### General Notes
* sudo apt install pipenv -- used this command to give me permission to install pipenv
	+ note: sudo su changes me to the super user, all powerful omniscient being. be careful (type "exit" in command line to become mortal)
	+ note: this is just for installing system files
* pipenv install packageName -- install a python package into virtual python environment
* tmux kill-session -t 0 -- kill a tmux session (0 is the window ID)
* Idea: if I have time, I'd like to add an option to redact curse words, but instead of blocking out the whole word, I just want to replace the vowels with an asterisk (\*). 

## Testing
To run: pipenv run pytest

Throughout the project my dad, Greg Yut, helped me understand the nuts and bolts, presumably all the stuff I should've known prior to taking this class but didn't learn because I'm not a C S student (i.e. Linux syntax/quirks, troubleshooting tips, etc).
