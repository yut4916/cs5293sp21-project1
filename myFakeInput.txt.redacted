Dear Diary,

Hello, my name is ██████████████████████, but I go by ████. It's █████████████████████████. This project is due in ████████████████ and I definitely should've started it earlier. I was gonna start it █████████, but my partner ███████ surprised me with a short visit. This is a document that contains sensitive information. I sure hope my personal information is secure. It sure would f*ck*ng suck if ██ (Big ███████) found out all my secrets. I'd be really mad and would probably complain to President ██████ by calling ██████████. Even better, I'll call senator ██████ at ██████████ and give ███ a piece of my g*dd*mn mind.

f*ck f*ck d*mn sh*t what the p*ss
